ðŸŽ¯ The Goal of the Project
--------------------------

-> The main goal was pretty straightforward: to build a machine learning model that can look at a stock's past performance and predict its closing price for the next day. 
-> We wanted to see if we could create a simple yet effective tool to forecast market trends using historical data.

ðŸ“ˆ Our Data and Features
------------------------

-> The first thing we needed was data. We used a library called yfinance to automatically download historical stock prices and trading volume for any company we chose. 
-> But we didn't just give the raw data to the model. That's where a crucial step called feature engineering came in.
-> Instead of just using the daily closing price, we created new, more insightful data points for the model to learn from.
-> This is like giving an expert more than just the current temperatureâ€”you also give them the wind speed and humidity. 

Some of the key features we created include:

-- Simple Moving Averages (SMA): This calculates the average price over a short period, like 5 or 20 days. It helps us smooth out the daily noise and see the general trend.

-- Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): This is a momentum indicator that tells us if the short-term momentum is rising or falling compared to the long-term trend.

-- Relative Strength Index (RSI): This is a powerful indicator that helps us understand if a stock is being overbought or oversold.

-- Lagged Features: We also included the previous day's closing price and volume. This gives the model a direct look at what happened most recently.

Our model's target, what it's ultimately trying to predict, is the closing price of the stock on the following day.

ðŸ¤– The Predictive Model
-----------------------

-> For the core of our project, we chose a Random Forest Regressor. 
-> The best way to think about a Random Forest is not as one all-knowing expert, but as a "forest" of hundreds of little decision-making trees. 
-> Each tree learns from the data and makes its own prediction. 
-> The final answer the model gives is the average of all those individual trees' predictions. 
-> This makes it really good at handling complex data and avoiding some common pitfalls that a single model might fall into.

âœ… How We Measured Success
--------------------------

-> Once the model was trained, we had to see how well it actually performed. We used two key metrics to evaluate it:
-> Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): This tells us the average difference between the model's predicted price and the actual price. 
-> A lower number means the predictions were closer to reality.

R-squared: 
-- This is a value from 0 to 1 that tells us how much of the stock's price movement is explained by our model's features. 
-- An R-squate closer to 1 means our model is doing a better job of explaining the stock's behavior.

In short, this project is a complete pipeline that starts with raw data and ends with a validated, testable prediction model. 
It provides a solid foundation for understanding how machine learning can be applied to financial markets.
